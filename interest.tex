% I develop design tools to enable people's physical creativity with fabrication technology.\\
% Before, I explored interaction techniques with an ecosystem of wearable and mobile devices.
%I take a hybrid of design and technical approaches to develop interfaces that enhance users' digital experience and physical creativity with an ecosystem of devices.
%I develop technical and design approaches to build novel human-computer interfaces that enhance users' physical \textbf{interactivity} with computers, or enable their \textbf{creativity} of making physical objects of their design.
I study, design, and build user interface systems that enable people to interact with an eco-system of devices, from wearables, mobiles, appliances to fabrication machines such as 3D printers.
